Materials for the "Reproducible Documents, Websites, and Books with Quarto" workshop at [SDSS 2023](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2023/).

## Abstract

Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown for publishing dynamic and static documents with multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, blogs, or other online resources. 

### Workshop 1: Producing a Single Document

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Quarto for technical communication and computation. We'll teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto documents (HTML, PDF, presentations) and the use of RStudio's visual editor, which provides a user interface for editing all Pandoc markdown. We will also touch on authoring scientific manuscripts that adhere to specific journal styles. This workshop is designed for those who have some experience with R, RStudio, and R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto. You do not need to be an advanced user of any of these; however, we will assume you have authored computational documents before. The workshop should also be accessible to those who have experience with Jupyter Notebooks.

### Workshop 2: Producing Websites and Books

In this workshop, we'll teach you how to create Quarto projects with multiple documents and organize them as websites (including blogs) and books. This workshop is designed for those who have some experience with R, RStudio, and Quarto and want to learn how to take their skills further to create Quarto websites and books. You do not need to be an advanced user of any of these; however, the workshop will assume you have authored computational documents before. If you do not have prior experience with authoring Quarto documents in RStudio, we recommend taking the morning workshop on creating single documents with Quarto first.
