Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown for publishing dynamic and static documents with multi-lingual programming language support. With Quarto, you can create documents, books, presentations, blogs, or other online resources.

At SDSS 2023, we're offering two Quarto workshops:

-   Workshop 1: [Producing a Single Document]

-   Workshop 2: [Producing Websites and Books]

This workshop is hosted by the [2023 Symposium on Data Science and Statistics](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2023/) and supported by [Posit, PBC](https://posit.co/).
