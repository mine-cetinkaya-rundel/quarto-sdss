## Code of Conduct {.smaller}

> The American Statistical Association (ASA) is committed to providing an atmosphere in which personal respect and intellectual growth are valued and the free expression and exchange of ideas are encouraged. Consistent with this commitment, it is the policy of the ASA that all participants in ASA activities enjoy a welcoming environment free from unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

## Expected Behavior {.smaller}

> -   Model and support the norms of respect necessary to promote the conditions for healthy exchange of scientific ideas.
>
> -   In speech or conduct, do not insult or disparage other participants.
>
> -   Be conscious of hierarchical structures, specifically the existence of stark power differentials between students, early career statisticians and established career statisticians---noting that fear of retaliation from more established statisticians can make it difficult for students and early career statisticians to express discomfort, rebuff unwelcome advances, and report violations of the conduct policy.

# What is Quarto?

## Quarto ...

-   is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system
-   aims to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better

![Artwork from "Hello, Quarto" keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustrated by Allison Horst.](images/horst_quarto_schematic.png){fig-alt="A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto." fig-align="center"}

## Quarto

With Quarto you can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more.

. . .

<br>

*just like R Markdown...*

::: incremental
-   Consistent implementation of attractive and handy features across outputs: tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc.
-   More accessible defaults as well as better support for accessibility
-   Guardrails, particularly helpful for new learners: YAML completion, informative syntax errors, etc.
-   Support for other languages like Python, Julia, Observable, and more via Jupyter engine for executable code chunks.

## Your turn

Open `hello-penguins.qmd` in RStudio and with the visual editor. Render the document. Update your name and re-render. Inspect components of the document and make one more update and re-render. Compare notes with neighbors about updates you've made and note any aspects of the document that are not clear after the tour and your first interaction with it.

# Quarto CLI

## Revisit: What is Quarto? {.smaller}

Quarto is a command line interface (CLI) that renders plain text formats (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`) OR mixed formats (`.ipynb`/Jupyter notebook) into static PDF/Word/HTML reports, books, websites, presentations and more.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|4|12|17|18"

## Quarto, more than *just* `knitr`

. . .

We learned from 10 years of literate programming with `knitr` + `rmarkdown`

![](images/qmd-knitr.png)

## Quarto, more than *just* `knitr`

![](images/qmd-jupyter.png)

## Quarto: More than *just* `knitr`

![](images/jupyter-alone.png)

## Under the hood

::: incremental
-   `knitr` or `jupyter` evaluates R/Python/Julia code and returns a `.md` file along with the evaluated code
-   Quarto applies Lua filters + CSS/LaTeX which is then evaluated alongside the `.md` file by Pandoc and converted to a final output format
:::

## Aside: Lua filters {.smaller}

-   Here is an example of a Lua filter that converts strong emphasis to small caps, from <https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html>:

``` lua
return {
  {
    Strong = function (elem)
      return pandoc.SmallCaps(elem.c)
    end,
  }
}
```

. . .

-   Lua filters written by R/Python/Julia developers should be interchangeable between formats - not language specific!

. . .

-   We won't go into the details of writing Lua filters in this workshop, and you don't need to worry about learning about Lua filters unless you're working on extending Quarto.

# Navigating within RStudio

## Quarto workflow

Rendering a Quarto file in RStudio via the Render button calls `quarto render` in a **background job**, preventing Quarto rendering from cluttering up the R console, and gives you and easy way to stop:

![](images/background-job.png){fig-align="center" width="800"}

## Rendering

1.  Option 1: In RStudio as a background job, and preview the output.

. . .

2.  Option 2: In the Terminal via `quarto render`:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

quarto render document.qmd # defaults to html
quarto render document.qmd --to pdf
quarto render document.qmd --to docx
```

. . .

3.  Option 3: In the R console, via the `quarto` R package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(quarto)

quarto_render("document.qmd") # defaults to html
quarto_render("document.qmd", output_format = "pdf")
```

## Your turn

::: task
-   Open the last .qmd file you were working on in RStudio.
-   Compare behavior of rendering with
    -   RStudio \> Render,
    -   using the CLI with `quarto render`, and
    -   in the R console via `quarto::quarto_render()`.
-   If you're an RStudio user, brainstorm why you might still want to know about the other two ways of rendering Quarto documents.

# Quarto formats

## One install, "Batteries included"

-   RMarkdown grew into a large ecosystem, with **varying syntax**.

. . .

-   Quarto comes **"batteries included"** straight out of the box

    -   HTML reports and websites
    -   PDF reports
    -   MS Office (Word, Powerpoint)
    -   Presentations (Powerpoint, Beamer, `revealjs`)
    -   Books

. . .

-   Any language, *exact* same approach and syntax

# Wrap up

## What about R Markdown? {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   You can render existing R Markdown documents with Quarto and you can rename them to `.qmd` files to turn them into Quarto documents.

-   You don't have to do this -- R Markdown continues to be maintained.

-   However, new features are being developed for Quarto.

-   Additionally, Quarto

    -   Offers "batteries included" shared syntax across formats

    -   Allows you to choose your own editor and your preferred data science language

    -   Comes with richer and more accessible features out of the box

    -   Is actively developed
