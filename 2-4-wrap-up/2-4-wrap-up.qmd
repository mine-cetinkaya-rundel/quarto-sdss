# Troubleshooting

## Creating a minimum reproducible example

- For any coding question, start by creating a minimum reproducible example (reprex)

- You'll find that this task is less than trivial for a complex Quarto project

- But there's a good chance you'll solve your problem while creating the reprex 

## Getting help

- Review the FAQ: <https://quarto.org/docs/faq>

- Have a question, post on GitHub Discussion: <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions>

- Found (or think you found) a bug or have a feature request, open an issue: <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues>
